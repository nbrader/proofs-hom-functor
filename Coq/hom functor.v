(* Now we assert the axioms for reflexivity and transitivity. *)
(* These are proofs that our `leq` relation is actually a preorder. *)
Axiom leq_reflexive : forall x : FiniteInt, leq x x.
Axiom leq_transitive : forall x y z : FiniteInt, leq x y -> leq y z -> leq x z.

(* Functor from this preorder category to Type might be more complex to define, as we need to map each integer to a Type and define how morphisms act on elements of these types. *)
(* This part is left as an exercise, as the mapping would depend on the specific Types you want to associate with each integer. *)
